# CS4341 - Assignment 1
By Daniel Johnson, Matthew Spofford, and Wenjie Zhang

## Instructions
Our project contains two different runnable classes: `AStar` and `Analysis`. The `AStar` class is used to run the
program specified in the assignment description. The program takes in two command-line arguments as specified by the
assignment, including the filename of the board to use, and then a number from 1-6 representing which A* heuristic to
use. It then outputs everything specified in the assignment document.

The `Analysis` class is used to run our analysis testing. It randomly generated boards for us to analyze, and output
useful statistics to conduct further analysis with.
